ðŸ’» This is a remote control software that can allow you to remotely run commands on your other computers. Although it is very barebones and
may seem very limited, it was made this way, as I do not intend for this to be used as malware. There is no "startup" feature, ports are
not automatically opened on computers in which the client is executed, and the only ability you have is running commands. If I were to
implement more features, this may actually be used as malware, and I don't want that. This is simply a c# program for you to draw inspiration
from, as it was really difficult for me to write this (I only have 2 years of experience at this point).
